### Candace United

Conducted an analysis of my 5-a-side soccer team competing at Monash University in 2023. This served as preliminary practise for my goal of analysing English Premier League and UEFA Champions League matches/players. Analysing my team was fun, revealing surprising star performers each season. The analysis also provided a basis for predictions ahead of the 2024 competition.

### UEFA Champions League

Conducted a detailed analysis of player statistics from the UEFA Champions League 2021-22 season, utilising a dataset that included metrics such as goals, assists, defensive actions, and passing accuracy. This project was part of a broader initiative to sharpen analytical skills in sports data. Insights derived from the analysis were instrumental in identifying key performers, suggesting potential player transfers, and understanding team weaknesses. The findings not only highlighted top performers and strategic insights but also set a foundation for predictive analytics for future competitions.
